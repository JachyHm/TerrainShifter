# TerrainShifter
Simple app for vertical terrain shifting for TrainSimulator2020

## Instalation
Simply download latest binary files from [realeases](https://github.com/JachyHm/TerrainShifter/releases) ([newest version v0.1](https://github.com/JachyHm/TerrainShifter/releases/tag/v0.1)) and run it in desired route folder.
Always make sure you backed up every file which can be accessed by this app!

## Usage
1. Move application into root of route to move (usually <RailWorksRoot>\Content\Routes\<GUID>\) and double click it.
1. Application will then ask for z offset. This represents how much the terrain will be shifted in meters. Positive values would increase terrain, negative decrease.
1. Wait until application makes everything needed and press any key to exit.
1. All done!

## General recommendations
* **Always make sure, you've backed up all route files before running this app. However it should not touch any files except of terrain ones and it should make backup automatically, it's awlays better to have multiple backups, than loosing many hours of work!**
* *If any problem occurs, feel free to create ticket here on GitHub, same goes if you have any ideas what can be added, or reworked*)
